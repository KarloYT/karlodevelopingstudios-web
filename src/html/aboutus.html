  <a class="invis">.</a>
  <div class="smallerTXT"><a>At KarloDevelopingStudios (KDS), we stand firmly against racism in all its forms. We believe in the inherent value and dignity of every individual, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background. Our company is built on the foundation of inclusivity and equality, and we are committed to creating a safe, respectful, and nurturing environment for everyone.

    Racism undermines the very essence of humanity, perpetuating unjust disparities and sowing seeds of discord in our communities. We reject racism because it denies people the opportunity to thrive, stifles creativity, and hinders progress. We understand that by embracing diversity, we unlock a wealth of perspectives, ideas, and talents that enrich our collective experiences.
    
    Our commitment to eradicating racism is driven by a moral obligation to do what is right, to challenge systemic prejudices, and to break down barriers that have hindered progress for too long. By fostering an anti-racist culture, we empower our employees and customers to engage in open dialogue, educate one another, and work together to build a fairer, more compassionate society.</a></div>

    We stand firmly against discrimination, prejudice, and any form of injustice that targets LGBTQ+ individuals. Our commitment to LGBTQ+ equality is grounded in the belief that every person deserves respect, acceptance, and the freedom to love whomever they choose.
    
    We understand that the LGBTQ+ community has faced historical and ongoing challenges, and we are dedicated to being part of the solution. By fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment within our company, we aim to promote diversity and empower LGBTQ+ individuals to thrive both personally and professionally.</a></div>

<div class="smallerTXT"><a>We dare to dream of a world where the chains of sexism are shattered, and true gender equality reigns supreme. We are warriors against discrimination, fighting to build a future where every individual, regardless of their gender identity, can rise and thrive on an equal playing field.

  In a society riddled with stereotypes and biases, we stand firm against the tide of sexism. We believe in a culture that celebrates the strength, resilience, and brilliance of all genders. No longer shall we be confined by the limitations of traditional norms, for we dare to challenge and dismantle them.
  
  Our quest for equality knows no boundaries. We champion the rights of women, advocate for the voices of men, and uplift those with non-binary or gender non-conforming identities. Together, we forge a path where everyone is free to define their destiny, breaking free from the chains that bind.</a></div>
